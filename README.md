## Goals

1. Build something that will help my kids with **TEST TAKING SKILLS**.

## Test Taking Best Practices

1. Do the **EASY** questions first.
2. Don’t spend too much **TIME** on questions.
3. **DROP** any obviously wrong answers.
4. Mark **HARD** questions to go back to.
5. Watch for **ANSWERS** in the question.
6. Don’t **CHANGE** your answer once selected.
